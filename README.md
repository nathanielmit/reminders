# reminders
Small python program using tkinter to set reminders.

I use this at work by assigning the script as an autohotkey so that it can be run quickly when I need to remember to do something at a specific time during a shift. When I have something to set, I run the script with a key-combination, type the reminder description and time (in the format h:mm AM/PM). Windows then creates a popup when the time arrives.
